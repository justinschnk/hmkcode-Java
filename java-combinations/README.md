Non-Recursive Algorithm for Finding Combination
===============================================

Here is a generic non-recursive algorithm for finding all possible combination for an array of objects. 

For example, if we have an Array of elements=`{"A","B","C","D","E"}` and we want to find the combination of these elements taken 3 at a time.
Using math we can find the number of possible combination using a known [formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination).

However, to find those combinations we need an algorithm to do so.
Below image explains the steps taken by the algorithm to find the results.
